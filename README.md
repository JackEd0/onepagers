## Developpers

You can see the sites in its best form by using a server. A great example is the extension `Live Server` on Visual Studio Code.

### Ideas

- Generate a portfolio.
- Try material design and other popular css frameworks.

### For great background images

Search using `bing` for `background for scooter shop`, or even using `bing-ai`.

## Prompts

### Notes

`gpt-4` is the worst, `chatgpt` is the best but doesn't give pictures and `bing-ai` is barebone but give link to realy good pictures.
The best website so far has been done using `chatgpt` with `bootstrap` as a helper. See `scooters\4.html`.
